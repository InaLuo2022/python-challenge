# python-challenge
The python-challenge will include two folders PyBank & PyPoll.

PyBank: 
The python script is to analyze the financial records in 'budget_data.csv' for the following values:
    1. The total number of months included in the dataset
    2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    4. The greatest increase & decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The final financial analysis is located in '.analysis/budget_data.txt'

PyPoll:
The PyPoll 'election_data.csv' is about a small, rural U.S. town vote data with three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
The Python script is created to analyze the votes database and calculate each of the following values:
    1. The total number of votes cast
    2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
    3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
    4. The total number of votes each candidate won
    5. The winner of the election based on the popular vote
The result is located in the subfolder of 'analysis/PyPoll.txt'

Brief instructions to run these python scripts mentioned above.
    a. Open the folder of PyBank or PyPoll in the Visual Studio Code
    b. Click main.py and run
    c. The analysis result will generate directly as a text file in the subfolder of the analysis
